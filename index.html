        <h2>
          Hello! I'm Zack! A Computer Science Major at Wilkes University,
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am fascinated by the many applications of software systems in the field of STEM,<br><br>
          My passion for technological integration started in high school. I was a music student, and in my free time, a hobbyist Python programmer. I brought my hobby to the STEM department, where I programmed the Autonomous mode for our FIRST tech challenge robot. I loved watching all of the team's talented engineering and ingenuity come together into an awesome project. From here, I wished to pursue this path further.<br><br> 
          Since deciding to study Computer Science at Wilkes, I've gained essential IT and System Administration work experience, as well as Software Engineering and AI integration experience from my studies, an award-winning project at HenHacks 2025, and ICPC.<br><br> 
          My current focus is tying together my background in IT, System Administration, Networking, and Programming to solve present, and growing real-world challenges. I am looking to bring that curiosity and technical edge to a team where I can continue to learn and apply my knowledge further.<br><br>
