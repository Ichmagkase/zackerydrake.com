        <h3>System Administrator and lab TA, Wilkes University</h3>
        <p>
          At Wilkes University, I'm a system administrator that helps manage 
          the hardware and software of two Linux labs, users of those labs, 
          the Math/CS webserver (including DNS and webpage hosting), LDAP, and file 
          storage servers/services. Users include students from Computer Science, 
          Data Science, Cloud Computing, as well as students that take fundamental 
          programming courses at Wilkes University in the Math/CS department. Professors 
          also use the Math/CS webserver for delivering content for their students. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also currently the lab TA for CS246, Intro to C and Unix, on standby with
          assistance for software or hardware issues.

          I.T. Intern at UFCW Federal Credit Union

        <p>
          In the Summer of 2025, I was the I.T. intern at a local credit union.
          As an I.T. intern, I was primarily troubleshooting and resolving issues present
          on Windows 11 and Windows Server. These issues included hardware issues, 
          issues and questions about proprietary banking software, and network issues. 
          I also worked on updates and deployments of security software, new hardware, and 
          was as the forefront of automating email signatures using Active directory employee
          entries for 50+ users across multiple branches.

        <h3>DungeonsTogether</h3>
        <p>
          In the Winter of 2025, I took on a personal project Dungeons Together,
          a tool for myself and my friends to organize our homebrew campaigns easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          DungeonsTogether is a Dungeons and Dragons management platform for custom
          homebrew campaigns. The platform supports OAuth and user 
          authentication and creation of multiplayer campaigns and is my most recent
          development project, as well as my largest solo-development project.
        </p>
        <p>
          DungeonsTogether is a full stack platform using Typescript, React, TailwindCSS,
          for implementation of frontend design. Visual layout and designs were concepted using
          Figma, and are mindful of <a href="https://lawsofux.com">The Laws of UX</a>. The webpage
          is deployed and authentication is handled using Firebase. The backend is developed using
          Go for the REST API, and deployed using Docker on Google Cloud Run using Terraform for 
          infrastructure-as-code (IaC). Stateful user and campaign data is stored in a PostgreSQL 
          database. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Exta notes: One thing I wanted to practice besides full stack development, was 
          modern defensive programming practices. As well as researching and implementing 
          API security, I've consulted industry professionals from my local DEFCON group 
          for advice and pointers.

        <h3>Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) Digital Twin simulation</h3>
        <p>
          For my software engineering practicuum, I worked with one of my peers to 
          develop a cloud native implementation of a TMD digital twin. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So what is a TMD? A TMD is a massive device used in skyscrapers for
          stability against natural elements such as wind and earthquakes. It works
          by counteracting the force applied by external forces to cancel out undesirable
          movement. Our TMD simulation simulates this by generating AI-augmented simulation
          data to represent realistic earthquake scenarios against simulated building 
          parameters, and solves the simulation using differential equations to create 
          predictive outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The digital twin was built using Gitlab contaier registry for
          cloud image storage, Helm for fast setup of Kubernetes cluster, Apache Kafka for
          inter-service messaging and logging, Strimzi for easy setup of Kafka within a Kubernetes
          cluster, and Redis for state caching. The application implements microservice architecture
          and each service is scalable to meet performance needs.

        <h3>SelfQuest</h3>
        <p>
          In the Fall of 2025, I worked in a team of 3 to present SelfQuest to the 
          Lehigh Hacks 2025 hackathon, winning first place among 200+ participants. 
        </p>
        <p>
          SelfQuest is an AI reflection therapy webapp, which generates journal entries
          for a fictional character based on a short questionnare of the user's mental wellbeing.
          SelfQuest allows the user to decompress and express themselves through the lense of a 3rd 
          party, and relate and work through their mental wellbeing in a unique way through an interesting
          application of AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          SelfQuest is implemented using full stack cloud native technologies. 
          React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS were used to design and implement 
          the frontend, and serverless backend functions were implemented using 
          with Python. AWS CDK was used to deploy infrastructure components 
          such the REST API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB using infrastructure
          as code (IaC) principles.

        <h3>RoomReady</h3>
        <p>
          In a team of 4, I helped develop and present RoomReady to Henhacks 2025,
          a J.P. Morgan Chase sponsored hackathon, winning first place among over 
          470+ competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          RoomReady is a AI image analysis disaster preperation report generator.
          In plain English, the user take a picture of a room, upload
          it to RoomReady for analysis, and it will generate a report of actionable
          to-do steps on how to best prepare the room for natural disasters given 
          known weather and climate data provided by NOAA's API.
        </p>
        <p>
          RoomReady implements full-stack technologies, including React and Typescript
          on the frontend, and Python with FastAPI in the backend. We interfaced with 
          the Google Gemini API to provide server-side prompting and AI parsing.
