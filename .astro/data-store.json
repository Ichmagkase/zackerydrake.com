Think of it like\na locked bulletin board; Its only purpose is displaying information, and only\nyou have the key to manually update the information on the website\n\n**Domain name**: The actual name of the website. example.com is the domain name of\nexample.com, zackerydrake.com is the domain name of the site you're most likely\nreading this on.\n\n**Domain Name System (DNS)**: The phonebook of the internet. If you want to get to\nzackerydrake.com, you type zackerydrake.com into your browser, and DNS figures\nout WHERE that website actually is. In this tutorial our website will be hosted\non a free service called Cloudflare Pages (**WHERE**), which creates domain\nnames that looks something like \"example-website.pages.dev\", but we will have\nour own domain name \"example.com\" that DNS will use to figure out **HOW** to get\nto our page on Cloudflare Pages.\n\n**Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: This is what actually publishes your website\nto the internet. A CDN can deliver your website worldwide!\n\n**GitHub Repository**: Think of a repository as a place to store a bunch of\nfiles. On GitHub, we'll create a repository where we'll store all of our\nwebsite's files.\n\n### Tools and platforms we'll use\n\nWe'll use a couple tools and platforms to help us streamline our website making\nprocess:\n\n**Wordpress** ([wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org)): A free tool for\ncreating websites visually by dragging and dropping elements, typing directly\nin the site, and previewing our website before deploying it. Aka a\n[Content Management System (CMS)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/content-management-system).\n\n**Local**: A tool that lets you edit Wordpress sites right on your own computer\nfor free.\n\n**SimplyStatic**: A tool that will let us export the code for our website\n\n**GitHub** ( [github.com](https://github.com) ): A platform for sharing code\nand files. Usually used by developers for collaborating and sharing code. We'll\nuse GitHub as a middleman to help share the generated code of our website.\n\n**Cloudflare**: Offers a CDN (using Cloudflare Pages) and DNS. We'll be able to\nname and deploy our website all in one spot.\n\n## Designing our website\n\nFirst we need to make our website. We'll be using Local for installing and editing\nour Wordpress site right on our own computer.\n\n- [Installing Local](https://localwp.com)\n\nAfter installing Local, you'll be greeted with a \"Welcome to Local\" page prompting\nyou to create an account. An account is not necessary for our purposes, and you can\nclose this using the X in the top right.\n\n![Local welcome page](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/localwp-welcome.png)\n\nCreate a new page\n\n![Local setup](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/create-a-site.png)\n\nGive your website a title,\n\n![local setup title](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/site-name.png)\n\nKeep the preferred environment,\n\n![local setup environment](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/site-env.png)\n\nAnd **create** a username and password for your Wordpress admin. Save this login,\nas we'll use it later on to design out website.\n\n![local setup admin](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/wp-setup.png)\n\nAfter the setup, Local will install Wordpress, which may require you to select\n\"allow\" if you're on Windows. Once in you'll be prompted with the Local dashboard,\nwhere you can either preview or edit your website.\n\n![local setup dashboard](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/local-dashboard.png)\n\nSelect **WP Admin** to start designing your website. You will be prompted to\nlog in. Use the same admin username and password you used before while\nsetting up local.\n\nAt this point, you can start designing your website from the Dashboard. Since\nthis is not specifically a Wordpress tutorial, I won't go over the nitty gritty\ndetails of designing a website. From the dashboard, you can start by clicking\n**Open site editor** or **Edit styles** and play around with your site. There\nare also tons of YouTube tutorials, documentation, and articles that can help\nwith this part.\n\nOnce in the dashboard, we'll need to **install the Simply\nStatic plugin**. In the navigation on the left side, open Plugins and click\n\"Add plugins\"\n\n![local add plugin](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/local-plugins.png)\n\nSearch for Simply Static, and install the **Simply Static - The Static Site Generator**\nplugin.\n\n![install simply static](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/simply-static.png)\n\nOnce installed, you'll be redirected to the plugins page where you need to **activate**\nSimply Static:\n\n![activate simply static](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/simply-static-activate.png)\n\nYou will gain a Simply Static tab in your navigation towards the bottom. From here,\ngo to \"Deploy\" and change Zip Archive to Local Directory. Make note of the **PATH**\nshown, or specify a path yourself. We'll be using this path to deploy our project\nin the next steps. Make sure to **save settings** before continuing.\n\n![local deploy](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/local-deploy.png)\n\n**Wait** to click generate until after the next step. GitHub Desktop won't let you\ncreate a repository in a file with stuff in it, so we'll wait to generate.\nLater on, you can click \"Generate\" to generate your website to your file path under\n\"Deploy.\" Again, make note of this path as we'll use it later. This process\nusually takes a couple minutes (I've had it run for usually 5 or 6 minutes). In\nthe **Activity Log** tab, the terminal-like output will say Done.\n\n**Note:** Sometimes Simply Static has trouble writing to a folder that hasn't been\ncreated, so make sure there is a folder at the path that you specify in Deploy.\nIf not, create one.\n\n## Publishing our website using GitHub\n\nOnce we have our website created and exported, we need to publish the code we\nexported for Cloudflare to see and deploy. We will use GitHub to share our code\nwith Cloudflare. Download GitHub Desktop at:\n\n- [Installing GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop?platform=windows)\n\nSign in or create a GitHub account, then Authorize connecting to GitHub Desktop\n\n![github-desktop-authorize](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/authorize-github-desktop.png)\n\nBack in GitHub Desktop, click Finish.\n\nNext, create a new repository by clicking \"Create a New Repository on your local\ndrive ...\", this is where the files for your website will be stored. Name the\nrepository, get the Local path to make sure it\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This step can make or break deploying your website. Make sure\nthe Path of the repository on your local drive is the **SAME** as the path under\nDeploy in the Simply Static plugin in Local, otherwise your website will not\nbe able to be deployed.\n\nIn GitHub Desktop, you can now publish your repository.\n\n![publish repository](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/publish-repository.png)\n\nAs you make changes to your\nwebsite in Local and generate your website with Simply Static, the changes will\nappear here. Once you have made and generated changes, add a summary of updates\nand \"Commit to main\" (your website). The first time you do this, it may take a moment.\n\n![github-commit](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/github-commit.png)\n\nPush your changes to your website to be\ndeployed.\n\n![git push](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/git-push.png)\n\n## Deploying our website using Cloudflare Pages\n\nFirst, create an account at [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)\n\nOn the Cloudflare dashboard, Create an application\n\n![cloudflare dashboard](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/cloudflare-account.png)\n\nLook for the prompt at the bottom of the box saying \"Looking to deploy Pages\"\nand click **Get started**. Get started and Import an existing Git repository.\nYou'll be prompted to select a repository to deploy a site from. Since we\nselect the repository you created and pushed from GitHub Desktop.\n\n**Note**: If you're connecting for the first time, you may need to give Cloudflare\naccess to your repository. Scroll down to the repository\naccess section and select your repository from the dropdown.\n\n![repository access github](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/repo-access.png)\n\nAfterwards, click **Begin setup**, then **Save and Deploy**\n\nIt will take a moment the first time it deploys your website. And with luck,\nyou should see:\n\n![deployed to earth](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/earth-deploy.png)\n\nAt this point, you can see your project with the link at the top, however\ninstead of being the name you likely want, I'll look something like\n\"yourrepositoryname.pages.dev\".\n\nClick **Continue to project** for the next steps\n\n## Naming our website using Cloudflare DNS\n\nNow that we have deployed our website, we need to give it a **domain name**\nthat represents us or our brand better. Something like **\"example.com\"** is\na lot cleaner and easier to remember than **\"examplerepository.pages.dev\"**\n\nIn Cloudflare, from the left navigation all the way at the bottom, you can\nfind **Domain registration** and under that, **Register Domain**.\n\n![domain registration](../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/register-domain.png)\n\nSearch for your domain name of choice here. You will get a selection of results\nto choose from. Domain names are usually priced between $10 for a year, or $20\nfor a year. Once you purchase a domain, you can link it to a project from **Account home**,\nselect your application name, **Custom domains**, **Setup Custom domain**, and type\nthe domain you just purchased here. Cloudflare will recognize it, and all you have\nto do is click **Activate Domain**. Usually within an hour, you can type your domain\nname into any browser on any device, and you will see your new website.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFrom this point, you can go back to **Local** and design your website. when\nyou're happy with the preview, you can use the **Simply Static** plugin\nto export your website and prepare it for deployment. Once it says **\"Done\"**,\ngo to **GitHub Desktop** to commit, and push your changes. This is all we\nhave to do! Since we dealt with all of the behind the scenes technical details\nalready, we don't have to worry about re-deploying, since Cloudflare and\nGitHub handles this for us. After deploying, check back at your website, and see\nyour changes after a couple minutes.\n\nHope this guide helped anyone who's been hesitant to dive into building their\nown website!","src/content/blog/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare.md",[21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38],"../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/localwp-welcome.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/create-a-site.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/site-name.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/site-env.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/wp-setup.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/local-dashboard.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/local-plugins.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/simply-static.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/simply-static-activate.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/local-deploy.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/authorize-github-desktop.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/publish-repository.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/github-commit.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/git-push.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/cloudflare-account.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/repo-access.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/earth-deploy.png","../../assets/building-your-own-website-with-localwp-and-cloudflare/register-domain.png","b40717beb2ac99f9",{"html":41,"metadata":42},"\u003Ch2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Nowadays, whether you’re in a creative industry, a technical industry,\nbusiness, or you would just like a corner of the internet to show off\nyour skills, the best way to centralize your portfolio is by having a website.\nHowever, the truth is for a lot of people, where to start is this big black box\nof tools, technology, dollar signs, and trying to decide which one is the best\nfit for your business or portfolio.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For post people who want to build their own website, there \u003Cstrong>three levels\u003C/strong> of\ndifficulty/price you’re faced with and could expect when building a website:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Easy and Expensive:\u003C/strong> Usually a service that manages all the technical details\nfor you, you just design and click “Publish” - usually for a paid subscription\n(often pricey!)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Moderately technical first-time setup, then cheap:\u003C/strong> This includes some\ntechnical details you will have to set up the first time you create your\nwebsite, but is free other than the domain name (usually between $10 to $20\na year)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>The web dev veteran approach:\u003C/strong> If you’re already comfortable with\nHTML/CSS/JavaScript, or you know a framework and how to you use, this article\nis most likely not for you.
